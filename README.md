##Iteration Drills

A set of drills I completed early in my Ruby education.

Said drills test my ability to iterate over:
* Arrays
* Hashes
* Compound Data Structures

The `iteration-drills_each-English.rb` file displays my ability to translate
each statements to English sentences. Similarly, the `iteration-drills_English-each.rb` file tests how well I can convert
grammatical sentences to each statements.
